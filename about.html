	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am a computer science engineering student with a passion for cybersecurity, music, and lifelong learning. As a CSE student, I have honed my skills in programming, software development, and database management. However, my true calling lies in the field of cybersecurity.</p>
	<p>I am fascinated by the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity and the constant need to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals. My goal is to become a cybersecurity expert and help organizations protect their systems and data from cyber threats.</p>
	<p>When I'm not studying or working on cybersecurity projects, I like to unwind by playing the piano. Music has always been a big part of my life, and I find that it helps me to relax and focus.</p>
	<p>Finally, as someone who is passionate about learning new things, I am always eager to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether it's learning a new programming language, exploring a new hobby, or delving into a new area of research, I believe that there is always something new to discover and learn.</p>
